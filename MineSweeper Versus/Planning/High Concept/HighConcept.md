# Intros:

## First
Crosta had had a reputation as a beautiful country, but of days it is having trouble. Since there is no food available due to the ongoing war, fishing is the only option for survival. You must deal with nuclear bombs and electric eels, so it's not an easy assignment. Are you willing to save your family, then?

## Second
[CITY NAME]?? used to be known for being a beautiful country, but after the war there is little beauty or food to be found - except for in War Lakes, where there are fish and nuclear bombs aplenty. Carefully fish in these dangerous waters to try and feed your family - but be quick! You're not the only with the same idea, and you might just go home hungry if you aren't fast enough.


# Features (Page 1)

## Basis
- Play minesweeper with your friends in a fun[chill??]free-for-all

- Make your lives as challenging as you want: customize lake size and number of nuclear bombs left by the war

- Use the hints left by long-gone fishers to find where bombs are located and avoid them

- Fish enjoy the warmth of radiaton: the more bombs there are around a fishing spot, the more fish you will find!

- Don't just pick any random spot to fish: if you find a bomb, it will explode and take out some of your fish with you

- There are electric eels swimming in these lakes: they are attracted to fast movement and will stun you for a few seconds, if you fish too fast! []?? 

- After a bomb explodes, the remainining fishers still have a few minutes to fish until the radiation kills them

- Don't worry: all the fish you have with you by The End[emoji caixão]?? will revert to your families - whether you're dead or alive!

- Every fisher has a flag they can place on a fishing spot if they think there is hidden bomb. Fishers can see each other's flags - but careful! They may not always be correctly placed!

- [talk about scoring system]??
