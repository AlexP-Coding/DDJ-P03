# THEME 

## Theme
- People fishing in a war-torn country

## How it wraps the game
- Tiles with numbers are now score multipliers
- Players now fish for...well, fish, instead of turning tiles
- Bombs are now underwater nuclear bombs. The remaining players have that extra few minutes until radiation kills them
- Spots that freeze players are electric eels that electrocute them (do other players cringe at the poor man, and then pretend they didn't see him?)
- Might lead to a darker comedy
